# Setup guide for pilot libraries

OCR-D's software is a modular collection of many projects with many tools per
project that you can combine freely to achieve the workflow best suited for
OCRing your content.

All OCR-D software follows the same interface and common design patterns so
they can once you understand how to install and use one project, you know
how to install and use all of them.

## Installation

There are three approaches to installing OCR-D software:

  1) From PyPI (recommended)
  2) With docker
  3) From source

All OCR-D software comes with a README file with an `Installation` section that
should explain all three options.

For example, to install the
[`ocrd_tesserocr`](https://github.com/OCR-D/ocrd_tesserocr), the three options
are:

### From PyPI

This is the best option if you want to use the stable, released version.

```sh
sudo apt-get install git python3 python3-pip libtesseract-dev libleptonica-dev tesseract-ocr-eng tesseract-ocr wget
pip install ocrd_tesserocr
```

### With docker

This is the best option if you want to run the software in a container.

You need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

```sh
docker pull ocrd/tesserocr
```

### From git 

This is the best option if you want to change the source code or install the latest, unpublished changes.

We strongly recommend to use a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/OCR-D/ocrd_tesserocr
cd ocrd_tesserocr
make deps-ubuntu # or manually with apt-get
make deps        # or pip install -r requirements
make install     # or pip install .
```

## Testing the installation

For example, let's fetch a document from the [OCR-D GT Repo](https://ocr-d-repo.scc.kit.edu/api/v1/metastore/bagit/):

```sh
wget 'https://ocr-d-repo.scc.kit.edu/api/v1/dataresources/736a2f9a-92c6-4fe3-a457-edfa3eab1fe3/data/wundt_grundriss_1896.ocrd.zip'
unzip wundt_grundriss_1896.ocrd.zip
cd data
```

### Local installation

If you installed a package [from PyP](#from-pypi) or [from Git](#from-git), you
can run the OCR-D tools directly from your command line.

Let's binarize the images in file group `OCR-D-IMG`:

```
ocrd-tesserocr -I OCR-D-IMG -O OCR-D-IMG-BIN
```

### With docker

:FIXME: Not working as expected: https://github.com/OCR-D/ocrd_tesserocr/issues/84

You can spin up a docker container, mount the current working directory like so:


```sh
docker run -u $(id -u) -w /data -v $PWD:/data -- ocrd/tesserocr ocrd-tesserocr-binarize -I OCR-D-IMG -O OCR-D-IMG-BIN-DOCKER
```

Note how the CLI is exactly the same, the only difference is the prefix to instruct Docker.

## Running a small workflow

## With pip

The `OCR-D/core` will be installed with every OCR-D software package but you can install it manually like so:

```sh
pip install ocrd
```

The `ocrd process` command allows you to chain OCR-D software calls to simple sequential workflows:

```sh
ocrd process \
  'tesserocr-binarize -I OCR-D-IMG -O STEP1' \
  'tesserocr-segment-region -I STEP1 -O STEP2' \
  'tesserocr-segment-line -I STEP2 -O STEP3' \
  'tesserocr-recognize -I STEP3 -O OUTPUT' 
```
